This is a tutorial from the book "Learning to Program" by Steven Foote. The entire book covers creating a Chrome Extension that replaces all photos on someone's Facebook feed with whatever photos you decide. The tutorial covers regular expressions, testing, and works mainly with JavaScript. This is just a weekend project for me and I am using it to help advance my understanding of the langauges and concepts covered.
